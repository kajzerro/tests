Creating a microservice to act as a proxy for storing files using AWS S3, Azure Storage, and local storage involves several steps. Below is a detailed breakdown of the estimated effort and tasks required for each component of the project:

1. Project Setup and Initial Configuration
Spring Boot Application Setup:
Initialize a Spring Boot project using Gradle.
Configure necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Security, AWS SDK, Azure SDK, etc.).
Docker Configuration:
Create a Dockerfile for containerizing the Spring Boot application.
Kubernetes Configuration:
Write Kubernetes YAML files for deployment and service configuration.
Estimated Time: 1-2 days

2. Authentication Implementation
Simple Authentication:
Implement basic authentication using Spring Security.
Configure user roles and permissions.
Secure endpoints with appropriate authentication mechanisms.
Estimated Time: 1 day

3. File Storage Service Implementation
AWS S3 Storage Integration:
Configure AWS SDK and create service methods for uploading, downloading, and deleting files.
Azure Blob Storage Integration:
Configure Azure SDK and create service methods for uploading, downloading, and deleting files.
Local Storage Implementation:
Implement file operations for local storage (e.g., saving files to the filesystem).
Estimated Time: 3-4 days

4. API Development
File API Endpoints:
Create REST endpoints for file operations (upload, download, delete).
Ensure endpoints are secured and validate inputs.
Response Handling and Error Management:
Implement appropriate response handling and error management for all storage operations.
Estimated Time: 2-3 days

5. Unit and Integration Testing
Unit Tests:
Write unit tests for service methods and controller endpoints.
Integration Tests:
Set up integration tests to ensure proper interaction with AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and local filesystem.
Estimated Time: 2-3 days

6. GitHub Actions Pipeline
CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:
Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
Configure jobs for building the application, running tests, and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.
Estimated Time: 1-2 days

7. Documentation and Final Adjustments
Documentation:
Document the setup process, API usage, and deployment instructions.
Code Review and Refactoring:
Review code for any improvements and refactor if necessary.
Estimated Time: 1-2 days

Total Estimated Time: 11-17 days
Detailed Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Project Setup and Initial Configuration
Initialize Spring Boot project.
Set up Gradle build files with necessary dependencies.
Create Dockerfile and test Docker build.
Write Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files.
2. Authentication Implementation
Configure Spring Security for basic authentication.
Implement user roles and permission checks.
Protect endpoints with authentication.
3. File Storage Service Implementation
AWS S3:
Set up AWS SDK.
Implement file upload, download, and delete operations.
Azure Blob Storage:
Set up Azure SDK.
Implement file upload, download, and delete operations.
Local Storage:
Implement file operations (save, retrieve, delete from filesystem).
4. API Development
Create controller endpoints for file operations.
Implement input validation and response formatting.
Handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
5. Unit and Integration Testing
Write unit tests for individual service methods.
Set up integration tests for storage interactions.
Ensure tests cover edge cases and error scenarios.
6. GitHub Actions Pipeline
Create GitHub Actions workflow file.
Configure build, test, and deploy jobs.
Set up secrets and environment variables for deployment.
7. Documentation and Final Adjustments
Write comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and deployment.
Perform code review and refactor where necessary.
Final testing and validation of the complete application.
Conclusion
The total estimated effort for creating this microservice is around 11-17 days, depending on the complexity of the implementation and the developer's familiarity with the technologies involved. This estimate includes all necessary tasks from project setup to final deployment and documentation.
